Cardano Company Overview

Overview and Origin

Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) is a financial technology company that utilizes blockchain research and development to create financial tools for end consumers. It is the creator of the Cardano blockchain, and its tokens are available under the ticker ADA [2].

The company was founded in 2015, with the Cardano network going live in 2017 [2]. IOHK was founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood [1]. Hoskinson was one of the founders of the Ethereum network but left in 2014 after disputes with other co-founders. Charles Hoskinson was approached by Jeremy Wood to start an independent company, and IOHK was formed shortly thereafter.

IOHK was primarily funded by its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2016. Cardano raised approximately $62 million, selling roughly 25.8 billion ADA for $0.0024 per token [3].

Business Activities

The founding principle of IOHK is, in their own words, "Cascading disruption." Cascading disruption is the idea that many of the structures forming the world’s financial, governance, and social systems are inherently unstable. Minor perturbations can cause a ripple effect that fundamentally reconfigures the entire system. The company is committed to identifying and developing technology to trigger these perturbations in order to push towards a more fair and transparent order [1]. Cardano, as a project, aims to create a research-oriented cryptocurrency that is more environmentally-friendly, scalable, and interoperable than Bitcoin or Ethereum [4].

IOHK builds blockchain infrastructure for both the private and public sectors. The current global cryptocurrency market sits at $1.08 trillion [6]. However, the long-term goal of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole is to increase this market size over time. Decentralized apps running on blockchain infrastructure, the adoption of cryptocurrency for daily transactions, and the secure movement of packaged data make the industry a high-risk, volatile space, but one with immesurable upside potential. IOHK's success will depend heavily on adoption, their ability to stand out in the space, and the regulatory environment that unfolds as the space evolves.

IOHK has inherent advantages with Cardano's proof-of-stake verification network, creating a more sustainable, environmentally-friendly end product. They have also developed a more scalable model for transactions than their competitors and place a strong emphasis on creating a conducive environment for the development of decentralized apps on their platform. Their primary focus and competitive edge, however, lie in their commitment to creating a research-based, almost academic development environment internally within the company [1].

IOHK is the developer of Cardano. They also have a non-profit organization, The Cardano Foundation, overseeing Cardano ecosystem development. In addition, they have tasked EMURGO, a multinational blockchain technology company, with promoting the adoption of the cryptocurrency [2]. Cardano runs on the Ouroboros consensus protocol, where staking tokens determine an actor's permission to create blocks on the blockchain, sized relative to the amount of tokens staked. Cardano also supports smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Cardano network [5].

Landscape

IOHK operates in the blockchain industry. The industry itself emerged in 2009 with the introduction of the Bitcoin whitepaper. It is essentially a subset of the broader data and financial security world. In summary, Bitcoin started with politically motivated niche actors opposed to fiat central banking, primarily aiming to compete against central bank currencies. It eventually expanded into a massive speculative bubble with no practical transactional use. Along with this bubble came Ethereum and the concept of decentralized apps and broader ecosystems built on these base blockchains.

There are competing cryptocurrencies, companies, and technologies. In terms of direct competitors, Finterra and Block.one are likely the two most immediate competitors. Hashgraph, Bitcoin, and, in my opinion (though this may not be generally agreed upon), IOTA are the most formidable technology competitors.

Results

Cardano raised $62 million in its ICO at the beginning of the cryptocurrency bubble in 2017 [3]. Not only did Cardano survive the market crash in December 2017, but its current market cap is $8.8 billion [7]. The company actively encourages developers to create apps within its ecosystem.

Key metrics in the cryptocurrency space to measure success include market cap and adoption. Cardano is the 7th largest cryptocurrency by market cap [6]. However, the market cap has declined markedly from its peak of $94 billion in 2021, and the overall return on investment (ROI) has been less favorable compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Decentralized apps on the system recorded 5.8 trillion ADA transacted in app activity as of last January [8], and in June 2022, Cardano reported over 1,017 active applications on its platform [9].

Cardano is one of the very few alternatives to Bitcoin that have survived multiple market crashes. It has continued to attract developers and app creators.

Recommendations

I would recommend that IOHK focus on "quantum-proofing" Cardano. Whatever the actual risk may be to blockchains from quantum computing, security is paramount in any financial company. The belief, whether true or false, that quantum computers will break blockchains could harm any company that is not adequately prepared, even if quantum computers themselves never pose a threat.

People are concerned about quantum computing and its potential impact on cryptocurrency blockchains. Particularly when dealing with financial instruments and people's wealth, it is essential to address market concerns.

While there are options such as the Winternitz signature scheme [10], I am not an expert, and I am aware that the Cardano project itself has published research on this issue.

This area will require further research. The NIST is working on encryption standards for the quantum age, and many groups are working on solutions. The Winternitz signature scheme appears to be a promising solution at the moment, and many companies are adopting it.
