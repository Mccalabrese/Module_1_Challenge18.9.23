Cardano company overview

## Overview and Origin

* Input Output Honk Kong (IOHK) is a financial technology company using blockchain research and development to build financial tools for end consumers. It is the creator of the Cardano blockchain, tokens on which are available under the ticker ADA [2].

* The compnay was founded in 2015, with the Cardano network going live in 2017 [2].

* The company was Founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood [1].

* Hoskinson was one of the founders of the Etherum network, which he left in 2014 after disputes with other co-founders on the project. Charles Hoskinson was aproached by Jeremy Wood about starting an independant company. IOHK was formed shortly thereafter. 

* IOHK was primarily funded by it's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2016. Cardano raised approximatly $62 million, selling roughly 25.8 billion ADA for $0.0024 per token [3]. 


## Business Activities

* The founding principle of IOHK is, in thier own words, Cascading disruption. "Cascading disruption is the idea that most of the structures that form the world’s financial, governance and social systems are inherently unstable and thus minor perturbations can cause a ripple effect that fundamentally reconfigures the entire system. Our company is committed to identifying and developing technology to force these perturbations in order to push towards a more fair and transparent order" [1]. Cardano as a project is aimed at creating a research oriented cryptocurrency that is more enviromentally-friendly, scalable, and interoperable than Bitcoin or Etherum [4].

* IOHK builds blockchain infvastructure for the private and public sectors. Currently the global cryptocurrency market sits at $1.08 trillion [6], however the long term goal of the crtyptocurrency ecosystem as a whole is to increase this as time goes on. Decentralized apps running on blockchain infrastructure, the adoption of cryptocurrecy for daily transactions, and the secure movement of packaged data make the industry a high-risk, volatile space, but one with upper limits beyond real reason. I could list the gloabl market caps of the internet, the US dollar, or payment processing services, however this cant shed any real light of the potential market disruption of Cardano. As a company, IOHK's sucess will depend heavily on adoption and their ability to stand out in the space, as well as the regulatory enviroment that unfolds as the space moves forward.

* IOHK boasts some inherent advantages with Cardano in its proof-of-stake verification network. This creats a more sustainbale, enviromentally friendly end product. They also have created a more scalable model for transactions than their competitiors, and place a lot of focus on creating a condusive envirpoment for the development of decentralised apps on their platform. Their main focus and competative edge however is a general commitment to creating a research-based, almost academic development enviroment internally within the company [1].

* IOHK is the developer of Cardano. They also have a non-profit, The Cardano Foundation, that oversees Cardano ecosystem development. In addition, they have tasked EMURGO, a multinational blockchain texchnology company, with promoting the adoption of the cryptocurrency [2]. Cardano runs on the Ouroboros consenus protocol, in which staking tokens determines an actors permission to open blocks on the blockchain, sized relative to the amount of tokens staked. Cardano has smart contract support, using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the cardano network [5].


## Landscape

* IOHK operates in the blockchain industry.

* The industry in and of itself was really born in 2009 with the introuction of the Bitcoin whitepaper. The whole industy is essentially a tend of the broader data and financial security world. In an extreme sumation, I would say Bitcoin started with politically motivated niche actors that opposed fiat central banking. The goal was primarily to compete against central bank currencies. It bolloned into a massive speculative bubble with no practical transactional use, and with that bubble came etherum and the idea of decentralized apps and broader ecosystems layered on these base blockchains.

* There are competing cryptocurrencies, completing companies, and competeing technologies. In terms of direct competitiors, Finterra and block one are probably the two most immediate competitiors. Hashgraph, bitcoin, and (in my opionion but probably not generally agreed) IOTA are most likely the most intimidating tecnology competitiors.


## Results

* Cardano raised $62 million in its ICO at the begining of the cryptocurrency bubble of 2017 [3]. Not only did Cardano survive the market crash in December of 2017, but the current market cap is $8.8 billion [7]. The company is actively persuading developers to develope apps in its ecosystem.
  
* Core metrics used in the cryptocurrency space to measure sucess are market cap and adoption. Cardano is the 7th largest market cap cryptocurrency [6] however, market cap is down from a peak of $94 billion during 2021, and the overall ROI has been worse than Bitcoin and Etherum. Decentralized apps on the system had reached 5.8 trillion ADA transacted in app activity as of last January [8], and in June 2022 Cardano was self-reported to have reached 1017 active applications on the platform [9].

* Cardano is one of a very small number of alternatives to Bitcoin that have survived multiple market crashes at all. It has continued to attract developers and app creators. 


## Recommendations

* I would recommend that IOHK focus on "quantum-proofing" Cardano. For whatever risk there truely will be to blockchains from quantum computing, in any kind of feduciary or financial company secuity is paramont. The meme, true or false, that quantum computers will break blockchains will ruin any company not prepared, even if quantum computers themselves never do.

* People are concerned about quantum computing and its effects on cryptocurrency blockchains. Especially when dealing with financial instruments and peoples wealth, it is important to calm market concerns.

* I know that there are some options, such as Winternitz signature scheme [10], I am not an expert and I know that the Cardano project itself has published research on this issue.

* This area will require more research. The NIST is working on encryption standards for the quantum age, and may groups are working on solutions. The Winternitz signature scheme just seems to be a promising solution at the moment that many companies are utilizing.
