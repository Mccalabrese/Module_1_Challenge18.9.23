Cardano company overview

## Overview and Origin

* Input Output Honk Kong (IOHK) is a financial technology using blockchain research and development to build financial tools for end consumers. It is the creator of the Cardano blockchain, tokens on which are available under the ticker ADA. [2]

* The compnay was founded in 2015, with the Cardano network going live in 2017. [2]

* The company was Founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood. [1]

* Hoskinson was one of the founders of the Etherum network, which he left in 2014 after disputes with other co-founders on the project. Charles Hoskinson was aproached by Jeremy Wood about starting an independant company. IOHK was formed shortly thereafter. 

* IOHK was primarily funded by it's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2016. Cardano raised approximatly $62 million, selling roughly 25.8 billion ADA for $0.0024 per token. [3] 


## Business Activities

* The founding principle of IOHK is, in thier own words, Cascading disruption. "Cascading disruption is the idea that most of the structures that form the world’s financial, governance and social systems are inherently unstable and thus minor perturbations can cause a ripple effect that fundamentally reconfigures the entire system. Our company is committed to identifying and developing technology to force these perturbations in order to push towards a more fair and transparent order." [1] Cardano as a project is aimed at creating a research oriented cryptocurrency that is more enviromentally-friendly, scalable, and interoperable than Bitcoin or Etherum. [4]

* IOHK builds blockchain infvastructure for the private and public sectors. Currently the global cryptocurrency market sits at $1.08 trillion [6], however the long term goal of the crtyptocurrency ecosystem as a whole is to increase this as time goes on. Decentralized apps running on blockchain infastructor, the adoption of cryptocurrecy for daily transactions, and the secure movement of packaged data make the industry a high-risk, volatile space, but one with upper limits beyond real reason. I could list the gloabl market caps of the internet, the US dollar, or payment processing services, however this cant shed any real light of the potential market disruption of Cardano. As a company, IOHK's sucess will depend heavily on adoption and their ability to stand out in the space, as well as the regulatory enviroment that unfolds as the space moves forward.

* IOHK boasts some inherent advantages with Cardano in its proof-of-stake verification network. This creats a more sustainbale, enviromentally friendly end product. They also have created a more scalable model for transactions than their competitiors, and place a lot of focus on creating a condusive envirpoment for the development of decentralised apps on their platform. Their main focus and competative edge however is a general commitment to creating a research-based, almost academic development enviroment internally within the company. [1]

* IOHK is the developer of Cardano. They also have a non-profit, The Cardano Foundation, that oversees Cardano ecosystem development. In addition, they have tasked EMURGO, a multinational blockchain texchnology company, with promoting the adoption of the cryptocurrency. [2] Cardano runs on the Ouroboros consenus protocol, in which staking tokens determines an actors permission to open blocks on the blockchain, sized relative to the amount of tokens staked. Cardano has smart contract support, using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the cardano network. [5]
